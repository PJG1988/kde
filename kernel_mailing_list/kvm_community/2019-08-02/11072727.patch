Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Simplify mtty driver and mdev core
Date: Fri,  2 Aug 2019 01:59:03 -0500

Currently mtty sample driver uses mdev state and UUID in convoluated way to
generate an interrupt.
It uses several translations from mdev_state to mdev_device to mdev uuid.
After which it does linear search of long uuid comparision to
find out mdev_state in mtty_trigger_interrupt().
mdev_state is already available while generating interrupt from which all
such translations are done to reach back to mdev_state.

This translations are done during interrupt generation path.
This is unnecessary and reduandant.

Hence,
Patch-1 simplifies mtty sample driver to directly use mdev_state.

Patch-2, Since no production driver uses mdev_uuid(), and mdev's name
is already available using core kernel dev_name(), simplifies and removes
redandant mdev_uuid() exported symbol.

  vfio/mdev: Removed unused and redundant API for mdev name
