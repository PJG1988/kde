Subject: [PATCH 0/2] KVM: arm/arm64: Fix guest's PMR synchronization when
 blocking on WFI

It recently came to light that if we run a guest that actively uses
interrupt priorities to block interrupts, vcpus can end-up being
blocked while they shouldn't, leading to an unresponsive guest (a
slightly less than desirable outcome).

Patch #1 fixes the issue (which has been with us since 4.12), which I plan
to take in for 5.3 with immediate backport to stable.

Patch #2 is more of an RFC, as it also impacts the SVN AVIC support. It
moves the kvm_arch_vcpu_blocking callback to happen earlier, leading to
much better performances on ARM, and leading to the above fix to be
applied at the best possible spot. I'd welcome any comment/testing on
this, specially on non-ARM systems.
