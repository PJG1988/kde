```c

The previous version only contain patch 1 but when at it I noticed
more ways to hang it... so let's fix them all up...

v2:
- use safe_halt() as suggested [Sean]
- added two more patches

Peter Xu (3):
  tscdeadline_latency: Check condition first before loop
  tscdeadline_latency: Limit size
  tscdeadline_latency: Stop timer when reach max loop

#### [PATCH v7 0/3] KVM: x86: Enable user wait instructions
##### From: Tao Xu <tao3.xu@intel.com>

```c

UMONITOR, UMWAIT and TPAUSE are a set of user wait instructions.

UMONITOR arms address monitoring hardware using an address. A store
to an address within the specified address range triggers the
monitoring hardware to wake up the processor waiting in umwait.

UMWAIT instructs the processor to enter an implementation-dependent
optimized state while monitoring a range of addresses. The optimized
state may be either a light-weight power/performance optimized state
(c0.1 state) or an improved power/performance optimized state
(c0.2 state).

TPAUSE instructs the processor to enter an implementation-dependent
optimized state c0.1 or c0.2 state and wake up when time-stamp counter
reaches specified timeout.

Availability of the user wait instructions is indicated by the presence
of the CPUID feature flag WAITPKG CPUID.0x07.0x0:ECX[5].

The patches enable the umonitor, umwait and tpause features in KVM.
Because umwait and tpause can put a (psysical) CPU into a power saving
state, by default we dont't expose it to kvm and enable it only when
guest CPUID has it. If the instruction causes a delay, the amount
of time delayed is called here the physical delay. The physical delay is
first computed by determining the virtual delay (the time to delay
relative to the VMâ€™s timestamp counter).

Changelog:
v7:
	Add nested support for user wait instructions (Paolo)
	Use the test on vmx->secondary_exec_control to replace
	guest_cpuid_has (Paolo)
v6:
	add check msr_info->host_initiated in get/set msr(Xiaoyao)
	restore the atomic_switch_umwait_control_msr()(Xiaoyao)
