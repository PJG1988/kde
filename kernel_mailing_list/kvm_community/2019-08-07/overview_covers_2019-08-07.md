Hi,

This consolidates everything into a "here's what's remaining for Andrew
to add to his tree (for now)" series:

* The first patch is an updated version of one that is already in the akpm tree.

* The next two patches are already in the akpm tree, included here for
  completeness.

* The last 5 patches are new to this series, but were previously posted.

Changes since v2:

* Updated patch 1
    * Review feedback from Ira. (This only affected the code comments.)
      Added Ira's Reviewed-by.

    * Review feedback: Further collapsed the siw_umem code: siw_free_plist() is
      gone entirely.

* Added 7 patches:
    * 3 patches from the "mm/: 3 more put_user_page() conversions" series:
	"mm/ksm: convert put_page() to put_user_page*()"
	"mm/mempolicy.c: convert put_page() to put_user_page*()"
	"mm/mlock.c: convert put_page() to put_user_page*()"

    * "security/tomoyo: convert put_page() to put_user_page*()", now that
      Tetsuo has ACK'd it for going in via Andrew's tree.

    * "powerpc: convert put_page() to put_user_page*()": no reviews yet.

    * two patches that were already accepted:
	"drivers/gpu/drm/via: convert put_page() to put_user_page*()"
	"net/xdp: convert put_page() to put_user_page*()"

* Continued to omit 1 patch ("fs/io_uring.c: convert put_page() to
  put_user_page*()"), sent separately, because Jens Axboe is putting it into his
  tree.

* Added Rodrigo Vivi's ACK for the i915 patch.
* Added Tetsuo Handa's ACK for the security/tomoyo patch
* Juergen Gross has verified that his Signed-off-by is valid.
* Added Calum Mackay's Reviewed-by.

Changes since v1:

* 9 out of 34 patches have been reviewed or ack'd or changed:
    * Picked up Keith's Reviewed-by for patch 26 (gup_benchmark).
    * Picked up ACKs for patches 3, 10, 15, 16 (ceph, genwqe,
      staging/vc04_services, drivers/tee).

* Patch 6 (i915): adjusted drivers/gpu/drm/i915/gem/i915_gem_userptr.c to
  match the latest linux.git: the code has already been fixed in linux.git,
  as of the latest -rc, to do a set_page_dirty_lock(), instead of
  set_page_dirty(). So all that it needs now is a conversion to
  put_user_page(). I've done that in a way (avoiding the changed API call)
  that allows patch 6 to go up via either Andrew's -mm tree, or the drm
  tree, just in case. See that patch's comments for slightly more detail.

* Patch 20 (xen): applied Juergen's recommended fix, and speculatively
  (pending his approval) added his Signed-off-by (also noted in the patch
  comments).

* Improved patch 31 (NFS) as recommended by Calum Mackay.

* Includes the latest version of patch 1. (Patch 1 has been separately
  reposted [3], with those updates. And it's included here in order to
  make this series apply directly to linux.git, as noted in the original
  cover letter below.)

Cover letter from v1:

These are best characterized as miscellaneous conversions: many (not all)
call sites that don't involve biovec or iov_iter, nor mm/. It also leaves
out a few call sites that require some more work. These are mostly pretty
simple ones.

It's probably best to send all of these via Andrew's -mm tree, assuming
that there are no significant merge conflicts with ongoing work in other
trees (which I doubt, given that these are small changes).

These patches apply to the latest linux.git. Patch #1 is also already in
Andrew's tree, but given the broad non-linux-mm Cc list, I thought it
would be more convenient to just include that patch here, so that people
can use linux.git as the base--even though these are probably destined
for linux-mm.

This is part a tree-wide conversion, as described in commit fc1d8e7cca2d
("mm: introduce put_user_page*(), placeholder versions"). That commit
has an extensive description of the problem and the planned steps to
solve it, but the highlites are:

1) Provide put_user_page*() routines, intended to be used
for releasing pages that were pinned via get_user_pages*().

2) Convert all of the call sites for get_user_pages*(), to
invoke put_user_page*(), instead of put_page(). This involves dozens of
call sites, and will take some time.

3) After (2) is complete, use get_user_pages*() and put_user_page*() to
implement tracking of these pages. This tracking will be separate from
the existing struct page refcounting.

4) Use the tracking and identification of these pages, to implement
special handling (especially in writeback paths) when the pages are
backed by a filesystem.

#### [PATCH v4 00/20] KVM RISC-V Support
##### From: Anup Patel <Anup.Patel@wdc.com>

```c

This series adds initial KVM RISC-V support. Currently, we are able to boot
RISC-V 64bit Linux Guests with multiple VCPUs.

Few key aspects of KVM RISC-V added by this series are:
1. Minimal possible KVM world-switch which touches only GPRs and few CSRs.
2. Full Guest/VM switch is done via vcpu_get/vcpu_put infrastructure.
3. KVM ONE_REG interface for VCPU register access from user-space.
4. PLIC emulation is done in user-space. In-kernel PLIC emulation, will
   be added in future.
5. Timer and IPI emuation is done in-kernel.
6. MMU notifiers supported.
7. FP lazy save/restore supported.
8. SBI v0.1 emulation for KVM Guest available.

Here's a brief TODO list which we will work upon after this series:
1. Handle trap from unpriv access in reading Guest instruction
2. Handle trap from unpriv access in SBI v0.1 emulation
3. Implement recursive stage2 page table programing
4. SBI v0.2 emulation in-kernel
5. SBI v0.2 hart hotplug emulation in-kernel
6. In-kernel PLIC emulation
7. ..... and more .....

This series can be found in riscv_kvm_v4 branch at:
https//github.com/avpatel/linux.git

Our work-in-progress KVMTOOL RISC-V port can be found in riscv_v1 branch at:
https//github.com/avpatel/kvmtool.git

We need OpenSBI with RISC-V hypervisor extension support which can be
found in hyp_ext_changes_v1 branch at:
https://github.com/riscv/opensbi.git

The QEMU RISC-V hypervisor emulation is done by Alistair and is available
in riscv-hyp-work.next branch at:
https://github.com/alistair23/qemu.git

To play around with KVM RISC-V, here are few reference commands:
1) To cross-compile KVMTOOL:
   $ make lkvm-static
2) To launch RISC-V Host Linux:
   $ qemu-system-riscv64 -monitor null -cpu rv64,h=true -M virt \
   -m 512M -display none -serial mon:stdio \
   -kernel opensbi/build/platform/qemu/virt/firmware/fw_jump.elf \
   -device loader,file=build-riscv64/arch/riscv/boot/Image,addr=0x80200000 \
   -initrd ./rootfs_kvm_riscv64.img \
   -append "root=/dev/ram rw console=ttyS0 earlycon=sbi"
3) To launch RISC-V Guest Linux with 9P rootfs:
   $ ./apps/lkvm-static run -m 128 -c2 --console serial \
   -p "console=ttyS0 earlycon=uart8250,mmio,0x3f8" -k ./apps/Image --debug
4) To launch RISC-V Guest Linux with initrd:
   $ ./apps/lkvm-static run -m 128 -c2 --console serial \
   -p "console=ttyS0 earlycon=uart8250,mmio,0x3f8" -k ./apps/Image \
   -i ./apps/rootfs.img --debug

Changes since v3:
- Moved patch for ISA bitmap from KVM prep series to this series
- Make vsip_shadow as run-time percpu variable instead of compile-time
- Flush Guest TLBs on all Host CPUs whenever we run-out of VMIDs

Changes since v2:
- Removed references of KVM_REQ_IRQ_PENDING from all patches
- Use kvm->srcu within in-kernel KVM run loop
- Added percpu vsip_shadow to track last value programmed in VSIP CSR
- Added comments about irqs_pending and irqs_pending_mask
- Used kvm_arch_vcpu_runnable() in-place-of kvm_riscv_vcpu_has_interrupt()
  in system_opcode_insn()
- Removed unwanted smp_wmb() in kvm_riscv_stage2_vmid_update()
- Use kvm_flush_remote_tlbs() in kvm_riscv_stage2_vmid_update()
- Use READ_ONCE() in kvm_riscv_stage2_update_hgatp() for vmid

Changes since v1:
- Fixed compile errors in building KVM RISC-V as module
- Removed unused kvm_riscv_halt_guest() and kvm_riscv_resume_guest()
- Set KVM_CAP_SYNC_MMU capability only after MMU notifiers are implemented
- Made vmid_version as unsigned long instead of atomic
- Renamed KVM_REQ_UPDATE_PGTBL to KVM_REQ_UPDATE_HGATP
- Renamed kvm_riscv_stage2_update_pgtbl() to kvm_riscv_stage2_update_hgatp()
- Configure HIDELEG and HEDELEG in kvm_arch_hardware_enable()
- Updated ONE_REG interface for CSR access to user-space
- Removed irqs_pending_lock and use atomic bitops instead
- Added separate patch for FP ONE_REG interface
- Added separate patch for updating MAINTAINERS file

#### [PATCH v4 0/6] mm / virtio: Provide support for unused page
##### From: Alexander Duyck <alexander.duyck@gmail.com>

```c

This series provides an asynchronous means of reporting to a hypervisor
that a guest page is no longer in use and can have the data associated
with it dropped. To do this I have implemented functionality that allows
for what I am referring to as unused page reporting

The functionality for this is fairly simple. When enabled it will allocate
statistics to track the number of reported pages in a given free area.
When the number of free pages exceeds this value plus a high water value,
currently 32, it will begin performing page reporting which consists of
pulling pages off of free list and placing them into a scatter list. The
scatterlist is then given to the page reporting device and it will perform
the required action to make the pages "reported", in the case of
virtio-balloon this results in the pages being madvised as MADV_DONTNEED
and as such they are forced out of the guest. After this they are placed
back on the free list, and an additional bit is added if they are not
merged indicating that they are a reported buddy page instead of a
standard buddy page. The cycle then repeats with additional non-reported
pages being pulled until the free areas all consist of reported pages.

I am leaving a number of things hard-coded such as limiting the lowest
order processed to PAGEBLOCK_ORDER, and have left it up to the guest to
determine what the limit is on how many pages it wants to allocate to
process the hints. The upper limit for this is based on the size of the
queue used to store the scattergather list.

My primary testing has just been to verify the memory is being freed after
allocation by running memhog 40g on a 40g guest and watching the total
free memory via /proc/meminfo on the host. With this I have verified most
of the memory is freed after each iteration. As far as performance I have
been mainly focusing on the will-it-scale/page_fault1 test running with
16 vcpus. I have modified it to use Transparent Huge Pages. With this I
see almost no difference, -0.08%, with the patches applied and the feature
disabled. I see a regression of -0.86% with the feature enabled, but the
madvise disabled in the hypervisor due to a device being assigned. With
the feature fully enabled I see a regression of -3.27% versus the baseline
without these patches applied. In my testing I found that most of the
overhead was due to the page zeroing that comes as a result of the pages
having to be faulted back into the guest.

One side effect of these patches is that the guest becomes much more
resilient in terms of NUMA locality. With the pages being freed and then
reallocated when used it allows for the pages to be much closer to the
active thread, and as a result there can be situations where this patch
set will out-perform the stock kernel when the guest memory is not local
to the guest vCPUs. To avoid that in my testing I set the affinity of all
the vCPUs and QEMU instance to the same node.

Changes from the RFC:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190530215223.13974.22445.stgit@localhost.localdomain/
Moved aeration requested flag out of aerator and into zone->flags.
Moved boundary out of free_area and into local variables for aeration.
Moved aeration cycle out of interrupt and into workqueue.
Left nr_free as total pages instead of splitting it between raw and aerated.
Combined size and physical address values in virtio ring into one 64b value.

Changes from v1:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190619222922.1231.27432.stgit@localhost.localdomain/
Dropped "waste page treatment" in favor of "page hinting"
Renamed files and functions from "aeration" to "page_hinting"
Moved from page->lru list to scatterlist
Replaced wait on refcnt in shutdown with RCU and cancel_delayed_work_sync
Virtio now uses scatterlist directly instead of intermediate array
Moved stats out of free_area, now in separate area and pointed to from zone
Merged patch 5 into patch 4 to improve review-ability
Updated various code comments throughout

Changes from v2:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190724165158.6685.87228.stgit@localhost.localdomain/
Dropped "page hinting" in favor of "page reporting"
Renamed files from "hinting" to "reporting"
Replaced "Hinted" page type with "Reported" page flag
Added support for page poisoning while hinting is active
Add QEMU patch that implements PAGE_POISON feature

Changes from v3:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190801222158.22190.96964.stgit@localhost.localdomain/
Added mutex lock around page reporting startup and shutdown
Fixed reference to "page aeration" in patch 2
Split page reporting function bit out into separate QEMU patch
Limited capacity of scatterlist to vq size - 1 instead of vq size
Added exception handling for case of virtio descriptor allocation failure
