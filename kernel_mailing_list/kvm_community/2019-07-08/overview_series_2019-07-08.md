#### [PATCH 4.4 38/73] x86/speculation: Allow guests to use SSBD even if host does not
##### From: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>

```c
From: Alejandro Jimenez <alejandro.j.jimenez@oracle.com>

commit c1f7fec1eb6a2c86d01bc22afce772c743451d88 upstream.

The bits set in x86_spec_ctrl_mask are used to calculate the guest's value
of SPEC_CTRL that is written to the MSR before VMENTRY, and control which
mitigations the guest can enable.  In the case of SSBD, unless the host has
enabled SSBD always on mode (by passing "spec_store_bypass_disable=on" in
the kernel parameters), the SSBD bit is not set in the mask and the guest
can not properly enable the SSBD always on mitigation mode.

This has been confirmed by running the SSBD PoC on a guest using the SSBD
always on mitigation mode (booted with kernel parameter
"spec_store_bypass_disable=on"), and verifying that the guest is vulnerable
unless the host is also using SSBD always on mode. In addition, the guest
OS incorrectly reports the SSB vulnerability as mitigated.

Always set the SSBD bit in x86_spec_ctrl_mask when the host CPU supports
it, allowing the guest to use SSBD whether or not the host has chosen to
enable the mitigation in any of its modes.

#### [PATCH v7 01/12] perf/x86: fix the variable type of the LBR MSRs
##### From: Wei Wang <wei.w.wang@intel.com>

```c
The MSR variable type can be "unsigned int", which uses less memory than
the longer unsigned long. The lbr nr won't be a negative number, so make
it "unsigned int" as well.

#### [RFC v2 1/5] vfio-ccw: Fix misleading comment when setting orb.cmd.c64
##### From: Farhan Ali <alifm@linux.ibm.com>

```c
The comment is misleading because it tells us that
we should set orb.cmd.c64 before calling ccwchain_calc_length,
otherwise the function ccwchain_calc_length would return an
error. This is not completely accurate.

We want to allow an orb without cmd.c64, and this is fine
as long as the channel program does not use IDALs. But we do
want to reject any channel program that uses IDALs and does
not set the flag, which what we do in ccwchain_calc_length.

After we have done the ccw processing, it should be safe
to set cmd.c64, since we will convert them into IDALs.
