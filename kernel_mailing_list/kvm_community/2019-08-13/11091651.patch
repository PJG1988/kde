Subject: [PATCH v2 0/3] powerpc/xive: Fix race condition leading to host
 crashes and hangs

This series fixes a race condition that has been observed in testing
on POWER9 machines running KVM guests.  An interrupt being freed by
free_irq() can have an instance present in a XIVE interrupt queue,
which can then be presented to the generic interrupt code after the
data structures for it have been freed, leading to a variety of
crashes and hangs.

This series is based on current upstream kernel source plus Cédric Le
Goater's patch "KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Free escalation interrupts
before disabling the VP", which is a pre-requisite for this series.
As it touches both KVM and generic PPC code, this series will probably
go in via Michael Ellerman's powerpc tree.

V2 of this patch series adds a patch fixing a bug noticed by Cédric,
and also fixes a bug in patch 1/2 of the v1 series.

Paul.
